# Miriam McFate's 1926 Travel Journal

In 1926 my grandparents, Clarence and Miriam Abia McFate of rural Poweshiek County, Iowa, built a 'home' on the back of what I believe was a Model TT Ford truck, and moved the family (3 adults, 5 children and a dog) to Long Beach, California. They traveled 2800+ miles over the span of 41 days, about 35 of those moving from camp-to-camp. This collection is grandma's daily journal plus whatever supporting material I could dig up.

Be advised, this is a work-in-progress and still contains language that may be offensive to some. My grandmother meant no harm so please don't be offended; I will try my best to faithfully sanitize the language as this collection comes together.

## About CollectionBuilder CSV

The University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) was built using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

CollectionBuilder-CSV is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll, given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files

Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
