"Bid all good-bye." Left at 1:47. Drove to the river to river road and pulled to the road side to wait for Clarence. Who had gone into Grinnell. Built the fire as it was cold. Kept real comfee. Waited 1 hour. Soon got the move. Stopped at Victor for gas and oil Got our groceries. Left Victor at 4:25. Drove to Ladora, Ia.  Pulled onto a free campground. Got our supper and went to bed. Did not use the tent. All bunked together. Pretty near the track, so didn't really enjoy our rest. Has been cold and cloudy all day.
