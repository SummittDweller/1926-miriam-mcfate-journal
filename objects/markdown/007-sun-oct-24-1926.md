## Sun, Oct 24, 1926
Started this morning at 9:00. Drove 7 or 8 blocks, crossed the river. .50 cent toll for our gang on this bridge. About 1/4 mile wide, 18 miles from St. Louis. Good pavement all the way. Still traveling over hills and around curves. Filling stations, bill boards and eating houses every few miles. If one goes hungry, runs out of gas or looses his way its surely is his own fault. Hundreds and hundreds of cars on this drive pass us going both ways Â© Eight miles from the heart of St. Louis. Have no free campgrounds here. .50 cents a day. Some places $1.00.

Pulled in to the Sun Down campground and parked. Will stay here while Clarence & Grover locate the folks. Had our dinner. Kids are trying to enjoy their selves while waiting (1 1/2 hrs) Honk! Honk! Here comes Jack and Mr. Carnes. We got into their car, dirt and all and away we went on into the city. And I'll say St. Louis is a real city. Traffic of every description. And this is Sunday. Don't know what it is like on a week day. We finally got down to the house and we are all glad. Spent the rest of the day visiting.
