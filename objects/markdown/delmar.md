My father, [Delmar Clarence McFate](https://helge.mcfate.family/i00013) was born on 24-April-1920 and was 6 years of age when making the trip to Long Beach.  My dad always told me that he attended 2nd grade in Long Beach, but I never really considered the magnitude of that until recently.   

He passed away on 21-April-2010, 3 days short of his 90th birthday, and is buried in Tama's Oak Hill Cemetery.
