[Clarence's](https://helge.mcfate.family/i00008) father, [Samuel](https://helge.mcfate.family/i00016/) was born on 27-March-1839 in Philadelphia, PA.  Sameul's name is listed as the 1927 land owner of the farm as it appears on the map below.

My father would always tell me that his grandfather, Samuel, was awarded the family farmland in Sheridan Township for his service in the Civil War.  Documents show that he did indeed serve in Company G, 20th Iowa Volunteers at Prairie Grove, Vicksburg, and other battles.  He was mustered out in August 1865 in Mobile, AL.  

Samuel passed on 23-March-1926 and it's unknown if his death played into the family decision to move west later that year.  He, like many family members, is buried in Sheridan Cemetery, Poweshiek County, IA, about 1 mile from the old McFate farm.
