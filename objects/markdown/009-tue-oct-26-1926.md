## Tue, Oct 26, 1926
This is another day in the city. Nothing much to do today but visit. The boys did not find what they wanted so we girls will have to wait for our trip till tomorrow. Essie and I went down to their part of the city. This is one of the suburbs. There is all kind of stores, any direction you may care to go. Did not go to bed till midnight.
