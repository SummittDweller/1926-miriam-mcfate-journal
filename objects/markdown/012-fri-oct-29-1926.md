## Fri, Oct 29, 1926
This has been a real gloomy day here in the city. Very hazy, looks like rain. Clarence and Jack went down to the auto club to get a routing out of St. Louis.  Have tires changed and we are ready to ramble. They went out to camp and brought back our car, we start traveling again tomorrow. We have had a wonderful time while here. Boys went down to the bowling alley after supper. We girls went to bed.Rained most of the night.
