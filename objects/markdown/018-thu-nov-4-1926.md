## Thu, Nov 4, 1926
Got up 7:00. We did our work. Wrote some letters. Helped the kiddies make some doll clothes. The boys got the engine together, but couldn't get it started. Will try again tomorrow. Have new neighbors for to night. An old old man and woman driving an old horse with a dilapidated wagon. They look as tho they were nearly froze. I think they are pretty old for such jaunts. She begged coffee enough for their supper. They wanted some meat but did not let them have this. She looks as tho she might be part gypsy. Hope the sun shines tomorrow for their sake if not for ours.
