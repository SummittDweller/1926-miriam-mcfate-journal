## Sun, Oct 31, 1926
Got up early. Did not rain so we are all glad. Ready to start 7:00. Drove for about 8 miles and off goes a tire. These roads are awful, worst we have struck. Fixed it as best we could. Drove on till we came to another oil station, one mile this side of Frederichstown. Pulled up here and debated about what to do. Boys went up town to see if they could find something to help us out of our difficulty. Came back nothing doing. Grover took the bus and went back to Flat River Mo. This is back 30 miles to see if he could pick up something. He got back at 11:00 that night. No tires. Went to bed. Has been a nice day. Sure has shone bright all day.
