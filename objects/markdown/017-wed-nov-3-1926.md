## Wed, Nov 3, 1926
Didn't get up very early this morning. Got breakfast. The boys started work on the car, when along came two women tourist from Chicago enroute to Plant City Fla. They were having trouble with their Ford. Stopped to find out where the garage was. Grover looked the things over, found out it was dangerous to drive it. The whole dash board was broken so badly they could hardly steer it. He went up town and got a new board and fixed it for them. We girls had company for 4 or 5 hours. I washed our dirty clothes today. Lots of tourists going both ways. We are on the main highway so see them all. Have had a disagreeable south wind all day.
