## Mon, Nov 1, 1926
Did not get up very early. Got breakfast. We did up our work. Changed things around in our house. Boys went back up town. Came back with new wheels, tires and tubes. These are real truck tires 34 x 5. So we are in hope our tire trouble ends here. Changed wheels, this took some time. Left here 3:45. Have 40 mi. of pavement ahead of us. No town now for 24 miles. There is 7 filling stations in this 24 mile stretch. The country is about the same. We drove thro a stretch of timber, then out onto a little level stretch. Here will be a small farm, then back into the timber we go again. It is this way all along. This is the only road we can see. It is wide and well paved.

Lots of grades. We pulled one grade this afternoon in low for one mile and a half, not steep but winding up. This has been our hardest pull so far. Many places we can look ahead and see two or three S shaped curves ahead. Most of the road is built to avoid the worst hills so it runs in all direction. We drove on till dark forced us to seek a camping place. Pulled into a filling station to camp again, near Millersville, Mo. Not many tourist camps here in Missouri. Got our supper and went to bed. Sun shone all day, but the wind has been disagreeable.
