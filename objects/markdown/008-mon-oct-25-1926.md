## Mon, Oct 25, 1926
Didn't get up so early. We all enjoyed our nights rest. Went out to camp, gathered up our dirty clothes, brought them backed and washed. Clarence, Jack and Grover have been out seeing this city and looking for some tires to suit their needs. We girls are going sight seeing tomorrow.
