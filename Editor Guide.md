# Editor's Guide

When reading the journal, presumably in print, please consider marking up or highlighting the following:


## Mark-up

  - Paragraph breaks - Where are more needed?  Where should any be removed?
  - Interesting content - Please identify about 10% of the content (~3 pages) to be included in print.  Use brackets in the margin or some other marking.

## Highlighting - Please use a different color for each type

  - Tire problems/repairs [yellow]
  - Engine breakdowns/repairs [pink]
  - Gas and/or oil stops [orange]
  - Buying groceries [green]
  - Other non-fuel, non-grocery purchases [blue]
